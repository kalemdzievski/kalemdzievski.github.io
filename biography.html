	       		 		Aaron Paul Sturtevant born and raised in Emmett, Idaho in 27 August 1979 . 
	       		 		His father is a retired Christian Baptist minister so, whilst growing up, 
	       		 		he took part in church programs and performed in plays.
						He attended Centennial High School in Boise, Idaho. It was here, in eighth grade, that Aaron decided he wanted to become an actor. 
						He joined the theater department and got obsessed with the idea of acting for a living. After finishing school, Aaron moved to Los Angeles. 
						During the late 90s, he worked as an usher at the Universal Studios Movie Theatre in Hollywood. 
						His television debut was in an episode of ”Beverly Hills, 90210″(1990), which was followed by an appearance in another Aaron Spelling series, ”Melrose Place” (1992).
						On the big screen, Aaron played the estranged son of Jeff Bridges in K-Pax (2001) Tom Cruise’ brother-in-law in Mission: Impossible III ((2006).
						After appearing in several roles in American television, his breakthrough role came as Jesse Pinkman in the AMC series ”Breaking Bad” (2008). 
						The character was only supposed to last for one season but series creator Vince Gilligan changed his mind due to his chemistry with Bryan Cranston. 
						He has won two Emmy Awards for ‘Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series’ for this role (2010, 2012).
